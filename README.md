Project Motivation

For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from Airbnb available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.

I chose Airbnb data in Seattle, and have the following three questions:

What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Seattle?

What kinds of Airbnb homes are popular?

What are the most influential features about the rental price?

Data

The data about Airbnb in Seattle can be downloaded from Kaggle:

Seattle Airbnb Open Data

File Descriptions

Jupyter Notebook (seattle_airbnb.ipynb) works related to the above questions.

Result

Because of the weather, spring and summer are the busy season with higher rental price. But there still remains a question, why dose January have the highest occupancy rate?

Airbnb homes which have entertainment nearby, a soon response from host or flexible cancellation policy are more popular.

About rental price, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, neighborhood and type of properties play important roles.
